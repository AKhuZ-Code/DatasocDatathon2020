Project: UNSW DataSoc x Atlassian Datathon 2020 - Linear Regression Model
Date: 04/10/2020
Description:
  • I wanted to examine the effectiveness of government responses towards COVID-19
  • Programmed and implemented a Linear Regression Model that would predict the future number of cases/deaths/recoveries using various predictors including: government responses taken, current number of cases/deaths/recoveries
  • The columns for number of cases/deaths/recoveries were normalised using the population of each country
Results:
  • Overall, the R-squared for the model ranged between 0.25-0.3, and so it wasn't worthwhile incorporating it in our analysis
  • We have a range for our R-squared as we tested the model with three different response variables (without changing the predictors): future cases, future deaths, future recoveries
